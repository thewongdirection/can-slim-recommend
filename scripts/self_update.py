self_update.py - make sure a run uses the newest published version of this skill.

A skill that refuses to screen on stale prices should not screen on stale rules either.
This checks the source repo before the run starts and, with --apply, installs the newer
version in place - so the thresholds, the grade cut, the scoring rubric and the guardrails
actually being followed are the current ones.

  python scripts/self_update.py            # check only: is there a newer version upstream?
  python scripts/self_update.py --apply    # check, and install it if there is
  python scripts/self_update.py --json     # same, machine-readable on stdout

It handles every way this skill gets installed:

  git clone       - compares HEAD against the branch tip and fast-forwards. Never rebases,
                    never touches a dirty or diverged worktree. (A check fetches the branch
                    into the object store when the commit is not already there; nothing in
                    the working tree changes until --apply.)
  unpacked files  - no .git (a zip, a plugin directory): compares every file against the
                    branch's archive and rewrites only the ones that differ, drops the ones
                    an earlier run installed that upstream has since retired, and records
                    the commit and file list in .skill-version so the next check is one
                    API call.
  vendored        - committed inside a LARGER repo (dotfiles, a monorepo of skills): read
                    only. Rewriting it would clobber somebody's version-controlled files,
                    so it reports where the update belongs and changes nothing.

The last line of output is STATUS: <one of>

  current           this copy already matches upstream - carry on
  updated           a newer version was installed - RE-READ SKILL.md and references/ before
                    continuing, because what is in context is the old copy
  update-available  newer version found, check-only mode (no --apply)
  blocked           newer version found but not installable here (local edits, diverged
                    history, a read-only or vendored install, or a write that failed
                    partway) - carry on with this copy and say so
  unknown           could not reach the repo - carry on with this copy and say so

Exit codes match: 0 current/updated, 10 update-available, 20 blocked, 30 unknown.

This is never fatal to a run. A screen from a slightly older copy beats no screen at all,
as long as the report says which copy produced it.

Pure standard library.
